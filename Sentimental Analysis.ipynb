Can everybody please give [Lorden 00:00:26] a big round of applause for that great introduction? What an outstanding young man. Barack Obama: (00:34)\\nNow, it is good to be back here in Florida. I don’t know if we’ve got any Tampa Bay Rays fans here in Orlando? Big game tonight. It’s do-or-die time. Now, the last time the Rays were in the world series in 2008, Florida sent me to the White House. The Rays fell just a bit short then. But here in Florida, Democrats fell a little bit short in 2016 also. Over the next couple of weeks, Florida, you’ve got the chance to fix two mistakes. You’ve got the chance to set two things right. You can bring a World Series championship to the Sunshine State and you can send Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to the White House. We’ve got one week, Orlando. One week. Speaker 1: (01:36)\\n[Spanish 00:00:01:36]. Barack Obama: (01:37)\\n[Spanish 00:01:36]. One week until the most important election of our lifetimes. You don’t have to wait until next Tuesday to cast your ballot, you’ve got two ways to vote right now. Number one, you can vote early in person right now. Number two, you can vote from home with a mail-in ballot. Don’t wait. Put it in the mail or drop it off at a drop-box location today. Don’t take any chances, just get it done. Just go to IWillVote.com to find out where you can early vote in person or drop off your ballot. How many of you have already voted? If you’ve already voted, then your job is to go help your friends and family make a plan to vote because this election requires every single one of us. What we do this week will matter for decades to come. Barack Obama: (02:48)\\nNow I’ve sat in the Oval Office with both of the men who were running for president. Just in case you couldn’t tell, they’re very different people. I didn’t think that Donald Trump would embrace my vision or my policies, but I did hope for the country’s sake that he might show some interest in taking the job seriously. But he didn’t. He hasn’t shown any interest in doing the work or helping anybody but himself and his friends or treating the presidency as anything more than a reality show that can give him the attention that he craves, and he does crave attention. This week with everything that’s happening, you know what he brought up? He was fussing about the crowd size at the inauguration again, saying his was bigger. Who is thinking about that right now? Nobody accept him. But the rest of us have had to live with the consequences: More than 225,000 people in this country are dead, more than 100,000 small businesses have closed, half-a-million jobs are gone in Florida alone. Think about that. Barack Obama: (04:15)\\nWhat’s his closing argument? That people are too focused on COVID. He said this at one of rallies. “COVID, COVID, COVID,” he’s ',\n",
       "  'complaining. He’s jealous of COVID’s media coverage. If he had been focused on COVID from the beginning, cases wouldn’t be reaching new record highs across the country this week. If we were focused on COVID now, the White House wouldn’t be having its second outbreak in a month. The White House. Let me say this, I lived in the White House for a while. It’s a controlled environment. You can take some preventative measures in the White House to avoid getting sick, except this guy can’t seem to do it. He’s turned the White House into a hot zone. Some of the places he holds rallies have seen new spikes right after he leaves town. And over the weekend, his chief of staff said, and I’m quoting here, I’m not making this up, his chief of staff on a news program says, “We’re not going to control the pandemic.” He just said this. Speaker 1: (05:34)\\nYes, he did. Barack Obama: (05:35)\\nYes, he did. And yes, we noticed you’re not going to control the pandemic. Barack Obama: (05:39)\\nListen, winter is coming. They’re waving the white flag of surrender. Florida, we can’t afford four more years of this. That’s why we’ve got to send Joe Biden to the White House, because we cannot afford this kind of incompetence and disinterest. 12 years ago when I chose a vice-president, I didn’t know Joe all that well. We served in the Senate together. I notice, by the way, one of my great friends, Ben Nelson. Bill Nelson. See, I haven’t seen Bill in a while, so that’s why. Plus, he’s wearing a mask. But one of the great senators from Florida, and Joe and I served together with him. I had a lot of friends in the Senate, but Joe and I wasn’t the closest person. But he and I came from different places, we came from different generations, but I quickly came to admire Joe as a man who learned early to treat everybody he meets with dignity and respect. Bill will testify to this, Joe is somebody who lives by the words his parents taught him: “No one’s better than you, Joe, but you’re better than nobody.” He believes everybody counts. He believes everybody’s important. And that empathy, that decency, that belief in other people, that’s who Joe is, and that’s who he’ll be. Barack Obama: (07:12)\\nI can tell you the presidency doesn’t change who you are, it reveals who you are. Joe, time and time again, has shown himself to be a man of principle and character and he’s going to be a great president. For eight years, Joe was the last one in the room. Whenever I faced a big decision. He made me a better president, and he’s got the character and the experience to make us a better country. He and Kamala are going to be in the fight not for themselves but for every single one of us. Speaker 1: (07:49)\\nAmen. Amen. Barack Obama: (07:51)\\nListen, you’ve got a president right now, he wants full credit for an economy that he inherited, he wants zero blame for the pandemic he ignored. But you know what? The job doesn’t w',\n",
       "  'ork that way. You’ve got to be responsible 24/7. You’ve got to pay attention 24/7. Tweeting at the TV doesn’t fix things. Watching TV all day doesn’t fix things. Making stuff up doesn’t fix things. You’ve got to have a plan if you want to make people’s lives better. You’ve got to put in the work if you want to make people’s lives better. Along with the experience to get things done, Joe Biden has concrete plans and he’s got concrete policies that will turn our vision of a better fairer, stronger country into a reality. Barack Obama: (08:44)\\nLook, here’s the truth: The pandemic would have been challenging for any president, but this idea that somehow this White House has done anything but completely screw this thing up is nonsense. South Korea had its first case of COVID at the same time, the same week as the United States. Do you know that their per capita death rate is just 1.3% of what ours is? Think about that statistic. I’ve given this statistic a couple of times and people haven’t really focused on it. The number of people in Korea who have died of COVID per capita is less than 1.5%. What our death rate is. That’s thousands and thousands of people, if we had been as effective and responsible, whose lives would have been saved in this country. Just across the border in Canada, the death rate per capita is 39% what ours here is in the United States. We are the largest, the wealthiest, most powerful country on earth and we cannot somehow get a grip on this because our government hasn’t been doing its job. Barack Obama: (10:13)\\nLast week when Trump was asked if he’d do anything differently, you know what he said? He said, “Not much. Not much.” Really? Not much? You can’t think of anything that you might be doing differently, like maybe you shouldn’t have gotten on TV and suggested we might inject bleach to cure COVID? That’s not something you said maybe I shouldn’t have said that? Not much. Think about how hard the tourism industry has been hit right here in Orlando, right here in Florida. You lost one spring training season already, and he can’t think of doing anything differently? Barack Obama: (10:58)\\nJoe takes this seriously. He knows the emotional toll- Barack Obama: (11:03)\\nHe knows the emotional toll on grandparents when they can’t see and hug their grandkids. He’s not going to screw up testing. He’s not going to call scientists idiots. He’s not going to host super spreader events at the White House, and then take it on a tour all across the country. Joe will get this pandemic under control with a plan to make testing free and widely available. He’s going to get a vaccine to every American cost-free, and he’s going to make sure our frontline heroes never have to ask other countries for the equipment that they need to keep themselves safe. His plan will guarantee paid sick leave for workers and parents affected by the pandemic. He’s going to make sure that',\n",
       "  ' small businesses that hold our communities together and employ millions of Americans can reopen safely. Barack Obama: (12:04)\\nAnd he understands that we’re not going to rebuild the economy and put people back to work until we get this pandemic under control. It’s not that complicated. Donald Trump likes to claim he built this economy, but I just want to remind you that America created 1.5 million more jobs in the last three years of the Obama Biden administration than in the first three years of the Trump Pence administration. That’s a fact. Look it up. And that was before Trump could blame the pandemic. He, in fact, inherited the longest streak of job growth in American history. But just like everything else he inherited, he screwed it up. Barack Obama: (12:56)\\nAnd the economic damage that he inflicted by botching the pandemic response means he will be the first president since Herbert Hoover to actually lose jobs, first president since Herbert Hoover, back in the thirties. That’s a long time people. That’s almost a hundred years ago. He loves to talk about Black unemployment. Look how low Black unemployment … Well, you know what? Unemployment was really high when I came in, and we brought that unemployment low, and it kept on going low, and he wants to take credit for it. Says he’s the best president for Black folks since Abe Lincoln? Man! Now his advisors are out there saying, including his son-in-law. His son-in-law says Black folks have to want to be successful. That’s the problem. Who are these folks? What history books do they read? Who do they talk to? Don’t read? Is that what is going on? Barack Obama: (14:07)\\nBlack unemployment hit almost 17% during the great recession 10 years ago, and through a lot of hard work, Joe Biden and I helped get it down, and it kept on going down, not because Trump did anything. And then this year, because they screwed up the pandemic response, it’s soared back up to above 17% here in Florida. But it doesn’t have to be that way, Florida, if you go out and vote. Barack Obama: (14:45)\\nSi se puede. Yes we can. Listen, the only people truly better off than they were four years ago are the billionaires that got Trump’s tax cuts. In the meantime, he has not been able to manage extending relief to millions of families who can’t pay the rent right now, can’t put food on the table right now. Got no plan to reopen schools that need reopening or protecting teachers in the process. I don’t understand how it is that he cannot organize Republicans in Congress to do the right thing. And it’s not like it’s his money that we’re asking him to pay because he doesn’t pay taxes. Barely pays income tax. Barack Obama: (15:37)\\nWe know he’s got a secret Chinese bank account, so he may be paying taxes to the Chinese, but he’s not paying taxes here. First year in the White House, only paid $750 in taxes, in federal income taxes. $750. Can you imagine',\n",
       "  ' that? I mean, teachers pay more than that. Social workers pay more than that in taxes. Huh? Soldiers. Folks in uniform pay more in taxes than that. So how are you living large, and you’re not willing to do the right thing to make sure that we’re able to pay for quality schools for our kids, to provide veterans benefits for those who’ve earned them. Barack Obama: (16:35)\\nJoe Biden has a plan to create 10 million good clean energy jobs right here in America. It’s part of his plan to protect Florida from climate change and secure environmental justice, and he’s going to pay for it by rolling back those tax cuts to billionaires. And the thing is, Joe doesn’t just want to get back to where we were. He finally wants to make some long overdue changes so that our economy actually makes life a little easier for everybody. The waitress trying to raise a kid on her own, the student trying to figure out how to pay for next semester’s classes, the shift worker who’s worried about maybe being laid off, the cancer survivor who’s worried that her preexisting conditions might prevent her from being able to get coverage. Barack Obama: (17:32)\\nAnd speaking of healthcare, by the way, you may have noticed Republicans love saying right before an election how they’re going to protect people who have preexisting conditions. Have you noticed that? Well, you know what? Joe and I actually protected them 10 years ago with the Affordable Care Act. And you know those same Republicans who say they’re going to protect them, somehow they have tried to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act more than 60 times. And each time they try to repeal it, they say, “Oh, we’ve got a great replacement. It’s coming.” Everybody’s a little young here, but you guys remember Popeye? And remember that guy who always needed to borrow some money for a hamburger? He said, “Don’t worry. I’m going to be paying you back sometime soon.” Barack Obama: (18:27)\\nThat’s like Republicans with healthcare. They always say, “It’s coming soon. We’re going to be paying you back with a great replacement plan.” But that two weeks has been 10 years coming now. For the last 10 years, every two weeks, they say, “We’re going to have a great healthcare plan.” You know where it is? Because I don’t. The reason they don’t have a plan is because a plan doesn’t exist. They’ve never had one. They’ve instead attacked the Affordable Care Act at every turn, driving up costs, driving up the uninsured. Barack Obama: (19:04)\\nNow they’re trying to get the Supreme Court to take away your healthcare, right now, as quickly as they can, in the middle of a pandemic with nothing but empty promises to take its place. Think about what that would do to families right here in Florida. Florida has the highest enrollment under the Affordable Care Act of any state in America. Last week, Trump flat-out said he hopes the Supreme Court takes your health insura',\n",
       "  'nce away. Said it out loud. Don’t boo. Vote. And last night, he installed the Supreme Court justice who he hopes will help him do it. Don’t boo. Vote. Florida, this is serious. And Joe and Kamala will protect your healthcare. They will expand Medicare. They’ll make insurance more affordable for everybody. Barack Obama: (20:06)\\nBecause Joe knows that a president’s first job is to keep us safe from all threats, foreign, domestic, and microscopic. When the daily intelligence briefings flash warning lights about a virus, the president can’t ignore it, can’t be too lazy to read the briefing. When Russia puts bounties on the heads of our soldiers in Afghanistan, the commander in chief can’t be MIA, missing in action. Joe Biden would never call the men and women of our military suckers or losers because they were willing to sacrifice their lives on behalf of the American people. Joe Biden understands those troops are somebody’s kids, somebody’s dad, somebody’s mom, somebody’s husband, somebody’s wife’s, somebody’s father or mother. Barack Obama: (21:06)\\nAnd Joe Biden understands that there is glory and goodness in being willing to sacrifice on behalf of others, something that apparently this administration just doesn’t comprehend. Our current president, he whines that 60 Minutes is too tough. You think he’s going to stand up to dictators? He thinks Leslie Stahl’s a bully. Just yesterday, just yesterday, he said that Putin of Russia, Xi of China, and Kim Jong-Un of North Korea want him to win. We know! We know because you’ve been giving them whatever they want for the last four years. Of course they want you to win. That’s not a good thing. You shouldn’t brag. Barack Obama: (22:03)\\nThat’s not a good thing. You shouldn’t brag about the fact that some of our greatest adversaries think they’d be better off with you in office. Of course they do. What does that say about you? I mean, think about that. Why are you bragging about that? Come on. And that doesn’t make any sense. Joe Biden wouldn’t coddle dictators. He’ll promote human rights around the world, including in Cuba. Joe will restore our battered standing around the world because he knows our true strength comes from setting an example that the world wants to follow. A nation that stands with democracy, not dictators, a nation that can inspire and mobilize others to overcome threats like climate change and terrorism and poverty and disease. Barack Obama: (22:59)\\nAnd here’s one other thing. Joe and Kamala, when they are in office, they’re not going to have… You’re not going to have to think about them every single day. You’re not going to have to worry about what crazy things they’re going to say, what they’re going to tweet. They’re just going to be too busy doing the work. It just won’t be so exhausting. You’ll be able to go about your lives, knowing that the President’s not going to retweet conspiracy theories about ',\n",
       "  'secret cabals running the world or suggest, I mean, listen, our President of the United States retweeted a post that claimed that the Navy SEALs didn’t actually kill bin Laden. Think about that. And we act like, well, okay. It’s not okay. We’re not going to have a President when Joe Biden’s in office, that goes out of his way to insult people just because they don’t support him. He’ll be a President for all people, including people who didn’t vote for him because he knows that’s the job of being President. Barack Obama: (24:23)\\nI mean, we’ve gotten so numb to what is bizarre behavior. We have a President right now who lies multiple times a day, and this is not my claim. Even Fox news sometimes says, well, what he says, isn’t really true, he didn’t mean it. It’s not normal behavior. We wouldn’t tolerate it from a coworker. We wouldn’t tolerate it from a football coach. We wouldn’t tolerate it from a high school principal. I mean, we might have to put up with it if it was a family member, but we talk about them afterwards. Even Florida man wouldn’t be doing some of this stuff. Why would we accept it from President of the United States? And you know what I mean? Sometimes it’s almost too easy to make fun of it, but it’s serious. There are consequences to his actions. Barack Obama: (25:31)\\nIf he was just on Jerry Springer or something, you’d say well… But this is the most powerful office on earth. And when people see the President doing things like that, it emboldens other people to be mean and cruel and divisive and racist and it frays the fabric of our lives. It affects the way our children see things. When we tell our children to tell the truth, and then we have the person in the highest office in the land who doesn’t seem capable of doing so, that undermines our society. It affects the way our families get along. It affects the way the world looks at America and it distracts from the truly destructive actions that his cronies are doing all across the government as we speak, actions that affect your lives. Barack Obama: (26:34)\\nYou got the Environmental Protection Agency that’s supposed to protect our air and our water. It’s run by an energy lobbyist that gives polluters free rein to dump unlimited poison into our air and our water. It’s not right. It ain’t right. The Labor Department, that’s supposed to protect workers. It’s run by a corporate lobbyist who’s declared war on workers, trying to gut protections to keep essential folks safe during a pandemic, making it easier for big corporations to steal their wages. The Interior Department, that’s supposed to protect our public lands, our wilderness, the Everglades, it’s run by an oil lobbyist who’s just fine with selling them to the highest bidder. Barack Obama: (27:27)\\nYou’ve got an education department run by a billionaire who has gutted rules designed to protect students from getting ripped off by for-profit co',\n",
       "  'lleges. And then is stiff arming students looking for loan relief in the middle of an economic collapse. You’ve got the person who runs Medicaid, trying not to get more people on the Medicaid so they’ve got better healthcare, but to kick more people off of Medicaid. Come one. It ain’t right. So what are you going to do about it? You got to vote. You got to vote. When Joe and Kamala are in charge, they’re not going to surround themselves with hacks and lobbyists. They’re going to surround themselves with qualified public service, who actually are serious about doing their job, who are looking out for you, for your job, your family, your health, your communities, your planet, and that more than anything is what separates them from their opponents. Barack Obama: (28:40)\\nThey actually care about you. They actually care about every American and they’re going to be fighting on your behalf every single day. They’re not going to get everything right every time. They’re not going to solve every problem right away, but they’re going to be working on it every single day to see how can I make sure this little brand new baby right here is inheriting a better world. That’s what they care about. I will say that I miss kissing babies during pandemic. I can’t do it, but I look at that a little bundle right there, brand new. It’s got the new baby smell. Congratulations. But Joe and Kamala, they care deeply about people and they care about our democracy. They believe that in a democracy, the right to vote is sacred. We shouldn’t be making people wait in line for hours. We should be making it easier for everybody to vote, not harder. Barack Obama: (29:54)\\nThey believe that no one, especially the President, is above the law. They understand that protest isn’t un-American. This country was founded on protesting against injustice. And we don’t threaten to throw our political opponents in jail just because we disagree with them. That’s what happens in dictatorship. That doesn’t happen in the United States of America. Joe and Kamala understand that our ability to work together to solve big problems like the pandemic depends on more than just photo ops. It depends on applying facts and logic and science and not making things up, not flooding the internet with misinformation. These should not be Republican or Democratic values. Barack Obama: (30:52)\\nThey’re what we grew up learning from our parents and grandparents. They’re not white or black or Hispanic or Asian or Native American values, they’re supposed to be American values. And we have to reclaim them right now. And how are we going to do that? By voting. We’ve got to turn out like never before Orlando. We have to leave no doubt. We can’t be complacent. We were complacent last time. Folks got a little lazy. Folks took things for granted. And look what happened. Not this time, not in this election. I understand there’s some Americans w',\n",

Listen, the government’s not perfect, it’s not going to solve every problem, but a good government can make things better. Barack Obama: (31:53)\\nThings were better when I left office, than when I started. They weren’t perfect, but they were better. A President shouldn’t make things worse. A President by himself can’t solve every challenge facing our economy. But if we elect a President who cares and we elect a House and a Senate and a State House and a State Senate that are focused on working people and getting you the help you need, it can make a difference. A President by himself can’t eliminate all racial bias in our criminal justice system. But if we elect District Attorneys and State’s Attorneys and Sheriffs and Police Chiefs focused on equality and justice, it can make things better. And that’s what voting is about. Not making things perfect, but making them better. It’s about putting us on track so that a generation from now we can look back and say, hey, things started getting better. It’s about using the power we have and pulling it together, to make- Barack Obama: (33:03)\\nIt’s about using the power we have and pulling it together to make sure that we have a government that’s more concerned, more responsive, more focused on you. And you know what? When I hear people say, well, I don’t know, I voted last time. Things didn’t change as much as I thought. Listen, we’ve never come close to seeing what it would be like if everybody voted. In 2008, that was the highest voting rate in modern presidential history. You know what? We only got to 61%. That means 39% of the folks didn’t vote who were eligible to vote. What would happen if suddenly we started getting 70% voting rates? What would happen if we got 60, 70% of the people voting instead of 55% of people voting? Barack Obama: (33:56)\\nThe country would be transformed. Imagine. Imagine January 20th and we swear in a president and a vice-president who have a plan to deal with this pandemic effectively, who believe in science, who have a plan to protect this planet for our children, who care about working Americans, who have a plan to help you start getting ahead, who believe in racial equality, who are willing to do the work to bring us closer to the ideal that no matter what you look like, where you come from, who you love, how much money you got, you can make it here in America. You’ll be treated with respect, and dignity and justice here in America. Barack Obama: (34:43)\\nImagine a president when Puerto Rico gets hit by a hurricane, doesn’t respond just by throwing paper towels, but says, those are Americans and we’ve got to make sure that we get in the help they need as quickly as possible. That’s what you should expect from a president. And if you’re not getting that, then you have ',\n",

We’ve seen folks of every age and background pack city centers and town squares so that families wouldn’t be separated. I’ve got a friend, Jose Andress, great restaurateur, took it upon himself, went down to Puerto Rico after the hurricane, organized thousands of meals just on his own because he was seeing that the response wasn’t quick enough. Just did it on his own. That is America. We saw people out on the streets saying, we’re not going to have our classrooms shut up anymore. We’ve seen people activated to make sure our kids don’t grow up on an uninhabitable planet. We’ve seen healthcare workers, so many of them all across the country, risk their lives every single day just to save somebody else’s loved ones. We’ve seen people contribute and volunteer to neighbors that have been hit hard. We’ve seen Americans of all races joining together to declare in the face of injustice and brutality at the hands of the state that black lives matter no more, but no less, for that no child in this country should feel the continuing sting of racism. That’s true in Orlando, it’s true in Florida, it’s true all across this country. Barack Obama: (37:08)\\nAmerica is a good and decent place, but we’ve just seen so much noise, and nonsense and distortion, and sometimes it’s hard for us to remember. But Orlando, I’m asking you to remember what this country can be, what it should be, what it must be. I’m asking you to believe in Joe’s ability to lead this country out of these dark times, to help us build it back better. Don’t abandon those who are hurting right now. We can’t abandon the kids who aren’t getting the education they need right now. We can’t abandon all those young people who are out on the streets who inspires. We’ve got to channel their activism into action. We can’t just dream for a better future, we got to fight for a better future. We got to out hustle the other side. We’ve got to vote like never before and leave no doubt. So make a plan, vote as early as you can, grab your friends and your family, get them to vote all the way up and down the ticket.

Kamala Harris: (06:56)\\nThat’s what we’re going to do. We know everything is at stake. Right now in our country we’re going through four crises, which have hit us all at the same time. We’re looking at a public health crisis, this pandemic. Over 220,000 people in just the last several months have lost their lives. Many without family members nearby to hold their hand because of the nature of this. Over almost nine million people who have been afflicted with this virus, who are going to have unknown long-term health consequences. Doctors are talking about lung scarring and things of that nature. People are suffering. Kamala Harris: (07:53)\\nMeanwhile, you have the president of the United States who took to a stage and said, “We’re rounding the corner.” Are you kidding me? Meanwhile, we have a president of the United States who thanks to Bob Woodward we know knew in January about how serious this is. He knew in January, January 28th, that it was five times more deadly than the flu. He knew on January 28th that it could hurt people of every age. He knew then that it was airborne, and he covered up that information, and he did not tell the American people. Moreover, he had the gall to call it a hoax, to suggest that there are two kinds of people on his ledger, the kind that wear masks and the kind that don’t.

What you as a frontline worker, what you as a parent, what you as a teacher, what you as a small business owner, would have done if you had known on January 28th? Because here’s the deal. Even before the pandemic, the situation in our country was such that people had to work two and three jobs to pay the rent and put food on the table. And by the way, in Joe Biden’s America nobody should have to have more than one job to put food on the table and pay the rent. But imagine what you would’ve done when we know most American families don’t even have $1,000 in life savings, and what people might’ve done to save up a little bit, knowing that they may not be able to go to work because still, in our country, people go to work without paid sick leave and paid family leave, something Joe Biden and I are going to end, making sure all workers are respected for the dignity of their work, including paid sick leave and paid family leave.

And part of the issue that I see, let’s remember this, from the time the guy was running for office until now, Donald Trump has had this weird obsession with trying to get rid of whatever Barack Obama and Joe Biden created. Do we need presidents with weird obsessions? No. Audience: (12:49)\\nNo. Kamala Harris: (12:51)\\nWe’re done with that, aren’t we? Audience: (12:53)\\nYeah.

Joe Biden, who was saying, “We will expand health coverage, we will bring down the cost of premiums, we wil bring down the cost of prescription drugs, we will lower Medicare eligibility to age 60, we know that health care means understanding the body doesn’t just start from the neck down, it includes the neck up, and that’s called mental health care.” There are clear choices in this election. And on the other hand, you have the current president who’s trying to get rid of coverage for over 20 million people. The crises we are dealing with. The crisis from this pandemic that is this economic crisis. Where over 30 million Americans, in just the last several months, had to file for unemployment insurance. Where here in Texas, we’re looking at one in ten families that has described their household as being hungry. Where here in Texas, one in six households is finding it difficult, if not impossible, to pay rent. Where here in Texas, one in four small businesses is out of business, and fear they will never be able to reopen. There’s a clear choice in this election. Because you see, on the one hand, you have Joe Biden. And when you ask Joe Biden, “How’s the economy doing?” Joe Biden says, “Well tell me how working people are doing.

Well one of the best ways to grow the economy and any family’s economic well-being is home ownership. So we’ll have a tax credit, a $15,000 for every new home buyer for down payments and closing costs.” That’s how Joe Biden thinks about the economy. On the other hand you have Donald Trump, who when asked about the economy, asks about the stock market. Asks about how rich people are doing. As one of his first orders of business, passed a tax bill benefiting the top 1%, and the biggest corporations of America. Kamala Harris: (16:26)\\nWell Rio Grande, I promise you this, as a first order of business, Joe Biden and I area about to work to get rid of that tax cut. And invest that money in working families. Invest that money on building back up our infrastructure, which means the creation of millions of jobs, building back up our infrastructure around roads, and bridges, and renewable energy.

Kamala Harris: (18:42)\\nLet’s deal with the disparities in terms of our public education system and put resources into Title One schools, knowing that is where our children who have such God given capacity, deserve to have the resources, to allow them to grow and develop and that is why we will triple Title One funding.

The president of the United States, who has his first order of business put in place a Muslim ban. We deserve better than this and Joe Biden in his heart, knows who we really are as America. Kamala Harris: (21:54)\\nJoe Biden in his heart, knows that regardless of where you live, your race, your gender, your age, the language your grandmother speaks, Joe Biden knows that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us and it is time that we reject hate and division and unify as a country. Kamala Harris: (22:25)\\nThere are clear choices. Let’s deal with an issue Texas knows well. The issue of the climate crisis. Speaker 1: (22:39)\\nKamala. Kamala. Kamala Kamala Harris: (22:47)\\nYou said it correctly. Kamala Harris: (22:54)\\nSo Texas knows, we’re dealing with a climate crisis as a world. We’re looking on the West Coast, you know where I’m from, we’re looking at wildfires from California to Washington, over to Colorado. Whole communities of people being burned out of their homes. I’ve met people who’ve been evacuated from their homes, never to be able to return. I’ve met with firefighters who were fighting fires while their own homes were burning. My brother-in- law’s a firefighter. Kamala Harris: (23:33)\\nWe look at the Gulf States, neighbors to Texas. There’ve been five named storms this year alone. They name a storm because it’s that bad; five. The most recent one being Zeta. Kamala Harris: (23:49)\\nWe’re looking at what’s been happening in the Midwest; farmers losing a whole season of crops because of the floods. Joe Biden says, we need to embrace science. We need to speak truth. We need to deal with this with timelines and a sense of urgency because we need to be able to breathe clean air and drink clean water, and see the connection between human behaviors and the crisis we are facing. Kamala Harris: (24:25)\\nJoe knows this is not on',\n",
       "  'ly about what we need to do for our environment, the opportunity in the moment is we can also create jobs. We can invest in infrastructure, in renewable energies, in solar and wind, and that will be millions of jobs. Kamala Harris: (24:46)\\nJoe also knows this is an environmental justice issue. When you’re looking at the fact that in all of the areas in the country that have poor air quality, 70% of the people who live in those places are people of color. Joe knows that and he understands how we can build back better in a way that we deal with the science. We build up an infrastructure where we’ll create millions of jobs and we do it in a way that is about equitable outcomes and we build back better. Kamala Harris: (25:27)\\nOn the other hand, you have Donald Trump. Okay. So here’s the thing. On the issue of the wildfire, as he was interviewed and the journalist said something like, these wildfires are happening in California and the scientists are saying that there’s a connection between the extreme weather and the fires. And the president of the United States, the commander-in-chief, responded, science doesn’t know. Can you imagine? And so science is a person. Literally rejecting the notion that we have so much evidence that is undisputed about what is upon us and the opportunity we have at the moment. Kamala Harris: (26:17)\\nSo Rio Grande, I say all this to say, there’s a lot that we need to deal with and these are many of the issues that are at play in this election and Texas has been turning it out. You guys have been turning it out and you have been turning it out. You have been standing in line. You’ve been organizing. You are making a huge difference. Kamala Harris: (26:47)\\nAnd so here’s the thing on voting. You know, I think there are three reasons that people need to vote. You know, when people ask, why should I vote? Why is it important? There are three reasons. I think. One, it’s important to vote. Kamala Harris: (27:02)\\nOne, it’s important to vote to honor the ancestors. Honor, the ances',\n",
       "  'tors, all those people who came before us who fought for our right to vote. People like John Lewis, the Congressman who passed away this year, who said, “Let’s get in good trouble.” John Lewis, who shed his blood on the Edmund Pettus Bridge for our right to vote. John Lewis, who knew this was a matter of civil rights and dignity. John Lewis, who understood that it was also a matter of civil rights and dignity to fight for same-sex marriage. John Lewis, who also knew it was a matter of civil rights and dignity to fight for protections for DREAMers and for a pathway for citizenship. So, it’s important to vote to honor the ancestors. Kamala Harris: (28:06)\\nThis year, we celebrated the 19th amendment which allowed women to vote. We celebrated the 100th anniversary of the 19th amendment. All those suffragettes who, a hundred years ago, marched and fought for our right to vote. Now, it’s important to remember history, because it wasn’t until 1965 that black women could vote, so we still have work to do, but it is time to vote to honor the ancestors, that’s reason number one. Kamala Harris: (28:42)\\nReason number two, everything is at stake. Everything is at stake. When this administration has orphaned 545 children because of a policy that has been about separating children from their parents at the border, everything is at stake. Kamala Harris: (29:10)\\nWhen we are looking at the fact that 200,000 of our frontline workers have been DREAMers who were promised DACA protection, everything is at stake. Everything is at stake when we need to create a pathway towards citizenship. Everything is at stake when we talk about equal pay for equal work for women. Everything is at stake. So, that’s reason number two. And then, here’s reason number three. So, I’ve been traveling the country, and I’ll tell you, just like here in Texas, there are powerful people around our country that have been making it really difficult for people to vote. Kamala Harris: (30:05)\\nThey’ve been passing laws. In North Carolina, they passed',\n",
       "  ' a law that the court that reviewed the law said it was written with surgical precision to prevent black people in North Carolina from voting. We have seen this around the country where laws have been put in place to make it difficult for people of color, for students, for our Native American brothers and sisters to vote, laws like here in Texas, where they’re taking the drop boxes, where in other places where they’re shutting down polling sites, where they’re requiring people to fill out two different envelopes if their mail-in ballot is going to count. The president who took the debate stage, and in front of 70 million Americans, openly solicited a suppression of the vote. Kamala Harris: (30:58)\\nSo, we have to ask why are so many powerful people trying to make it so difficult and confusing for us to vote? Why are they, for example, messing with the post office. I mean, the post office, the nicest people work for the post office. Why are they doing this? And, I believe it is because they know our power. They know our power and we know our power, and we will not let anyone take our power from us. And, that is the reason, that is the reason that we are all here today, to celebrate each other and to fight for this country we love. Kamala Harris: (32:16)\\nAnd so, my last point is this, this moment, this moment will pass. It will pass. And one day in the future, our children, our grandchildren, others, they will look in our eyes, each one of us, they’re going to look in our eyes and they will ask us, “Where were you at that moment?” And what we are going to tell them, as we were hanging out at UT Rio Grande Valley this Friday afternoon, on the last day of early voting, we will tell them we organized. We will tell them we brought people to vote. We will tell them we told them about what is at stake. We will tell them we reminded people of the ancestors and our responsibility and commitment to them. We will tell them that we elected Joe Biden, President of the United States. Thank you. Thank you, Rio Gr'],\n",
       " ['President Donald J. Trump: (02:08)\\nThank you very much. Wow. This is a very big crowd. Wow look at this. Hello North Carolina, hello. Two days from now we are going to win this great State just like we did last time. You were the one, right? You were the one that put us over that hump and we’re going to win four more years in the white house, our beautiful white house. With your vote we will continue to cut your taxes, cut regulations, support our great police, protect our Second Amendment, defend religious liberty and ensure more products are stamped with that beautiful phrase made in the USA. And next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. Under my leadership our economy grew at the fastest rate ever recorded, 33.1% just announced. We created a record 11.4 million jobs in the last five months while foreign nations are in a free fall, we’re creating the world’s greatest economic powerhouse. A recent Gallup Poll just came out, found that 56% of Americans say they are better off today than they were four years ago under Obama and sleepy Joe Biden. President Donald J. Trump: (03:53)\\nAnd I want to tell you it’s really windy up here. Thank goodness you have a President that doesn’t need teleprompters because these things are virtually useless. They are blowing all over the place. That’s true. They’re blowing all over. We started off today two great places. We went to Iowa, I’ll tell you what, in Iowa we had the coldest windiest, but it was warm because the people were warm and we’re going to win Iowa, very big, very big. But we had a couple of cold stops today. One was so cold we talked about refugees, we said, if they come in they’re going to say, “I want to go back immediately,” it was so cold. If Biden and Harris get in, the economy will collapse and our country will go into at least a free fall, but probably a depression, they want to raise your taxes. They want to take away your Second Amendment, they want to do lots of things that I don’t think you can stand for. President Donald J. Trump: (05:02)\\nI don’t think you can send for, fracking doesn’t pertain so much to it, it does pertain in a different way to you than it would to Pennsylvania. They’re taking away you’re fracking but what they’re really doing is your energy costs are going to go through the roof, that will be very bad for this incredible State. They want to massively increase regulations, send your jobs overseas, destroy the suburbs, well we’re keeping the suburbs. I got rid of the regulation that would have destroyed the suburbs, they will bring it back worse than ever before. Terminate religious liberty, eliminate school choice, outlaw private healthcare, and shred your Second Amendment, take away your guns and indoctrinate your children with anti-American lies. Biden has vowed to abolish U.S. oil, U.S. fracking, natural gas, industry. Look at what he’s talking about doing, but it’s not him, he’s shot, okay? It’s not him. President Donald J. Trump: (06:09)\\nIt’s the radical left, it’s the radical left. Energy prices will explode and that will cripple our country. We, right now, are energy independent, what we have going we’ve never had before. Biden’s energy ban will send every state from North Carolina to Michigan to Pennsylvania into a very, very severe problem and we’re not going to have it, we worked too hard. We had the greatest economy in the history of our country and then t',\n",

They stopped it from going into China, but it came to us and Europe and the rest of the world and we’re never going to ever forget, we will never forget. But now we’re building our economy back up and it’s going in a V, but it’s really a super V. As long as I’m President, we will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas on the planet earth and we will remain energy independent. Our opponents’ agenda is a war on workers, a war on faith and a war on our great police. Biden says he’s running as a proud Democrat, I’m running as a proud American. Speaker 1: (07:48)\\nUSA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! President Donald J. Trump: (07:48)\\nThank you. Thank you very much. By the way, I just have to say this. So we had something incredible happen four years ago. This is more important and there’s more energy, the crowds are bigger, everything’s hotter. But this is actually and I never thought I’d say it because that was an incredible period of time, never thought, this is the most important election perhaps in the history of my country. Get out and vote. Got to get out and vote. Sleepy Joe Biden is a diehard globalist who spent 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders and sacrificing American blood and treasure in ridiculous, endless wars and they’re all coming back, they’re all coming back. North Carolina lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs thanks to NAFTA, one of the worst trade deals ever. And we got rid of it, nobody thought that was possible. Promises made, promises kept. We did it all. Biden and his group shipped your jobs and your factories to China and other places in far away lands raking in millions of dollars for himself it turns out, we didn’t know about this, did we? His son was like a human vacuum cleaner, he went in and “Where are you going today, dad?” “I think I’ll go to Ukraine.” “Okay, let me pick up a couple of bucks.” $183,000 a month and $3 million upfront. “Where are you going today dad?” “I’m going to go to Russia,” “Good.” So the Mayor of Moscow’s wife gave him three and a half million dollars, right? And here’s the scary part, the fake news media and there’s a lot of it right back there, the fake news, they don’t want to talk about it, they don’t want to talk about it. And big tech will refuse to put it on and then they’ll terminate the New York Post if they put it up, New York Post I have to give them a lot of credit. Number one, they endorse me, which is nice. President Donald J. Trump: (10:06)\\nI got endorsed today by the Pittsburgh Gazette and it hasn’t happened where they endorsed a Republican today. Nobody can believe it, they haven’t done it in decades. And thank you very much Pittsburgh Gazette, we’ll take it. We got endorsed by a lot of great people, we got endorsed by great people and a lot of newspapers are endorsing us because they know that Joe Biden is not up to this job. All you have to do is watch him for about five minutes, he is not up to this job. One thing I can tell you, President Xi, Putin, Kim Jong-un, they’re very sharp, they’re very sharp, they’re all very sharp and we cannot have a leader that’s not sharp. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician who is bought and paid for by China and other countries. President Donald J. Trump: (10:57)\\nHow can you have a guy whose son walks out with a billion and a half dollars to mana',\n",
       "  'ge, that means millions of dollars a year, whose son asked for $10 million a year for introductory purposes, right? $10 million a year and he’s supposed to be negotiating with China? China would just hope that I don’t win because, hey, we’ve taken in tens of billions of dollars a year first time ever with China, we never took in $25 cents. Saved our steel mills, saved our steel mills, saved our steel and aluminum industries. In 2016, North Carolina voted to fire this corrupt political establishment and you elected a President who is finally putting America first. And if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician it’s because thankfully I’m not a politician and never will be. And if I don’t always play by … President Donald J. Trump: (12:03)\\nNever will be. And if I don’t always play by the rules of Washington and the Washington establishment, it’s because I fight for you and there’s never been anybody that’s fought harder for you. I had a very nice life before doing this. I had a very nice life. Speaker 2: (12:23)\\nWe love you! We love you! President Donald J. Trump: (12:33)\\nThank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. So nice of you. That’s such a great honor, when I hear that. It’s never been said at any… I said, “Did anybody ever hear that? Ronald Reagan we liked, others we like.” Nobody’s ever heard it, and I appreciate it very much. My opponent is promising a long dark winter. Did anybody see the debate? I’m sure nobody watched it, right? He didn’t do too well. Remember he said, “You’re going to have a long dark winter”? It’s so inspiring. How about somebody says, “Gee, we really like Biden”? I don’t think anybody likes Biden. “Harry, let’s watch Biden tonight on television.” And he says, “We’re going to have a long dark winter.” How inspiring that is, right? So he said that, and I’m saying that we’re going to deliver the greatest American comeback in history. That’s what we’re doing, and we’re way ahead of schedule. President Donald J. Trump: (13:32)\\nThis election is a choice between a Biden depression and a boom like you’ve never seen before. It’s a choice between a Biden lockdown. He wants to lock you down. Let’s lock it down. Let’s lock it down. And by the way, tell your Governor to open up North Carolina. It’s time. It’s ridiculous. It’s ridiculous. They’ll probably announce it on November 4th. “We’re going to open up now.” They thought our numbers wouldn’t be so good. They thought by keeping these states like Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Michigan, how about her? Her husband roams free. He’s the only one in the whole state. No, but they thought that by keeping them down the numbers would … And yet we had, at 33.1, that’s the highest in the history of our country. By double. You have to go back to 1952, and that was half of what we did. So we are looking forward. We’re going to have very shortly, within a couple of weeks, we’re going to have a safe vaccine that will end. President Donald J. Trump: (14:42)\\nAnd now look, we’re rounding, they hate when I say it, the fake news, but we’re rounding the turn. We’re rounding the corner anyway. We’re rounding the corner. But on top of that, we have vaccines coming from Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, great companies, and they’re right there, they’re right. And we’re going to have them launched. And our military is going to do it logistically. Incredible. And we’re going to start with our seniors, especially our seniors',\n",
       "  ' where they have some problems with heart, with diabetes, and we’re going to have a great thing. It’s going to speed up the process we launched. And by the way, it does work here. I am. Here I am. No, I like to say that the medicine I took, Regeneron, I’d like to say that it had no impact on me, because I’m a perfect physical specimen and I’ very young. But I decided to take it anyway. President Donald J. Trump: (15:40)\\nNo, it’s amazing the things we’ve been able to do in the last six months. Not only that, if you look at all of what we produce now, we’ve become a production … Incredible what we’re doing and what we’re sending to the world. The ventilators, what we’re sending to the world, I mean, we’re sending things that nobody could believe. The treatments that reduce the fatality rate now 85%. Think of it, think of it. But my wife, our First Lady got it and our son Baron got it. And Barron’s 14, and he’s very tall and he’s strong. And he had it for a matter of minutes. That’s why I say, “Get the kids back to school. Get them back to school.” The doctor came up to us and said, “I’m sorry, but Barron has tested positive.” And I said, “For what? Tested positive for what? And it’s got about 30 different names, but he said, “COVID.” President Donald J. Trump: (16:41)\\nWe could call it the China Plague, the China Virus, but he didn’t say. He said, “COVID. I said, “Gee, that’s too bad.” He said, “Oh, he’ll be fine.” About 14 minutes later, he came back. I said, “How’s Baron doing?” “Oh, he shook it off. It’s fine. He’s fine.” They’re young. They have strong immune systems. Get them back to school, please. We’ve learned about this horrible plague that was sent to us by China. Our excess mortality rate in America is 40% lower than Europe. You keep hearing Europe is doing so well. They’re not doing so well. And we want them to do well, by the way. And we helped them. We helped them. We want them to do well. But they’re having a very hard time. President Donald J. Trump: (17:27)\\nJoe Biden is promising to delay the vaccine and turn America into a prison state while letting rioters roam fee. They close your churches, they close your schools, but if you want to riot and burn down the stores and have the anarchists out there and do lots of it, that’s okay. You can’t stop that. You can’t go to school and you can’t go to church. It’s crazy. All Democrat run, by the way. All Democrat run. You look at Portland, Democrat, super liberal Democrat. We could fix that situation. We have to be invited in. We fixed Seattle because we said, “That’s enough. We’re going in. We don’t care. We’re going in.” So we were going in the next morning. That night they found out about it. They said, “We’re leaving now. Thank you very much.” And we did a great job in Minnesota, Minneapolis. After you watched that place burning, down a week and a half later, they went in and solved it in about a half an hour. President Donald J. Trump: (18:29)\\nIf we’d listened to Joe Biden on allowing travel to come in from China and Europe, remember he said, “Oh, he’s xenophobic.” Now, he runs for President, he said, “We should have acted sooner.” Months later, he didn’t think we should do it. Hundreds of thousands more people would have died. We saved two million people or more. Remember the model? It said 2.2 million people would die. Well, we saved two million people by acting quickly. Now, Biden wants a cruel and very heartless ',\n",
       "  'nationwide shut down. It won’t affect you, because you’re already shut down. I don’t know what the heck. What’s going on with your state? Are you ready to open up? I think so, huh? No, you know what? People aren’t going to take it anymore. Look at what happened in Europe, and the people are revolting. They don’t want to do it anymore. They can’t do it anymore. We can’t have the cure be worse than the problem itself. That was the first thing I said a long time ago. President Donald J. Trump: (19:34)\\nThe Biden lockdown will result in countless deaths and wipe out an entire generation of dreams. And we’ve learned that children with a computer do not do well compared to being in classes. They don’t do well. It’s not the same. And the parents have to go to work, and the problems that are caused with alcohol, drug abuse. We can’t let this happen. And you can’t let it go on. I have a feeling that probably they’ll say, “It’s now November 4th, the day after the election, we’ll go back. We’ll go back.” He should have never done that. And they should have never done that. And actually, the states that are doing best, look at Florida, look at all of these states where they had a spike and they didn’t close down. Look at what happened in Arizona. Look at what happened in Texas. We can’t let it happen. Europe imposed Draconian lockdowns, and yet their cases are exploding. Their deaths are surging and their economies are, let’s face it, you look at what happened, they’re in ruins. President Donald J. Trump: (20:37)\\nWe had the smallest down and the largest up and the largest fast up on the economy, by far. So the European lockdowns are leading to more suffering, delayed medical care, and financial devastation. A vote for Biden is a vote for lockdowns, layoffs, misery, and getting rid of your Second Amendment. They want to hurt our police, but they want to take away your guns. Very interesting, isn’t it? If you want a vaccine to kill the virus, a job to support your family, and freedom to live your life, then go cast your ballot, cast your vote for me. We’re going to do it. We’re doing it. But you don’t have to take my word for it, because in certain states that I like a lot, we spend a lot of money for, where is that rail? Look at that over there. Look at that.

Jake Tapper: (23:02)\\nAllowing China into the World Trade Organization, which you supported, extending most favored nation status to China, which you supported, that those steps allowed China to take advantage of the United States by using our own open trade deals against us.

Joe Biden: (23:25)\\nNo. Jake Tapper: (23:26)\\nBut doesn’t he deserve some credit for that? It’s better. The USMCA is better than NAFTA. Joe Biden: (23:31)\\nIt is better than NAFTA.

Now, sadly, what we showed you, that’s just from a couple of hours today because every time that Joe actually leaves the basement bunker and stays out past 10:00 a.m., well, disaster ensues.

Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids. Donald Trump does pose the next little spent to this… It’s not hypothetic. Speaker 4: (24:58)\\nThis is pretty serious. By the way, these are way beyond an occasional campaign gaff. And I am beginning… Well, I’m more than a little worried that this man could represent a clear and present danger to this country. He’s obviously not capable of leading. He’s been hiding the entire campaign and the corrupt media mob is covering for him. Joe wants to be the President of the United States of America. That would be the toughest job in the world. And at times, Joe doesn’t seem to remember that he’s even running for President or what state he’s in or what day of the week it is. Does anyone really believe that if elected that Joe Biden will actually be in control of anything? Joe Biden: (25:42)\\nWhat kind of country are we going to be?

President Donald J. Trump: (28:22)\\nA really wonderful person, wonderful woman, and she’s always with me, representative Virginia, Foxx. Virginia., thank you. Thank you, Virginia. Great job. You do. President Donald J. Trump: (28:34)\\nA man that I’d love to see in. He’ll open you up. I think we can get a guarantee tonight. Lieutenant Governor, Dan Forest. Come on Dan, win. Good, Dan. Boy oh boy, I tell you that would be a natural. That’s a natural. You’ll open it up right away. Okay. You should win just on that one. This is crazy. He’s doing what the Washington Democrats are telling him to do. President Donald J. Trump: (29:05)\\nAttorney General candidate Jim O’Neill, hi, Jim. I Great job, Jim. GOP Chairman Mike Whatley. How are we doing, Mike? Are we winning? Are we leading? The poll’s up. Right? Yeah, we’re up pretty good. We should be up. President Donald J. Trump: (29:24)\\nCan you imagine? Can you imagine pastor and a friend of mine and he lives right down the road, Pastor Franklin Graham. Franklin Graham: (30:01)\\nThank you, Mr. President. And I would like to just take a second to pray for this man. Will you join me? Father and our God, we pray for our President. Protect him and his family and protect our nation. And we pray this in Jesus’ name. Amen. President Donald J. Trump: (30:16)\\nYou take care of yourself. Thank you. It’s a great honor. That’s good genes right there. Right? That’s good genes, Billy Graham. How good was Billy Graham? Right? Nobody liked Billy. President Donald J. Trump: (30:36)\\nAfter years of rebuilding foreign countries, we are finally rebuilding our country. For 47 years, the Democrats viciously and brutally repeatedly attacked. And you know what we’re talking about because it was led by a man named Joe Biden… Black Americans, they attacked. Decimated the black middle class and called young black men super predators. To every black American, I am asking for y',\n",
       "  'ou to vote. You have to vote on Tuesday. You can send a message on Tuesday to the corrupt Democrat establishment. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. President Donald J. Trump: (31:25)\\nWe’ve had tremendous support and by the way, just so you understand, I don’t want to look at all those cameras. Oh, they’re all blazing. You ready? So we’re doing so well. And one of the great things that’s happened is our African American vote. Our black community vote is way up. And they’re all saying, “Wow, wow.” They’re all saying… Everybody back there is saying, “Wow, that’s amazing.” That’s what’s happening in Florida. That’s what’s happening here. That’s what’s happening all over. President Donald J. Trump: (31:58)\\nThis is your one and only chance to show sleepy Joe Biden what you think of his decisions to attack, insult, jail you. 1994, Bill, I’m fighting for you. And if you look at what we’ve done just quickly, criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunities zones with Tim Scott, historically black colleges and universities long-term funding. They had no funding. They had… Every year, they had to come back and ask for funding. I said, “Nope, we’ve got to get your long-term funding.” We got them more money than they wanted. They needed it. President Donald J. Trump: (32:37)\\nUnder my leadership, we achieved the most secure United States border in the history of our country. Biden would make every city in America a sanctuary city, which is not good. And it’s not Biden. It’s not Biden. It’s his handlers. I believe our country should be a sanctuary for law abiding American citizens. The Biden/Harris plan would also increase refugees 700%, opening flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism. You see what’s happening in France. I’m keeping terrorists, jihadists, and violent extremists out of our country. President Donald J. Trump: (33:26)\\nAnd I was asked, on this very windy night, speaking of that, to do a thing that we used to do during the campaign. I’ll do it. Has anyone heard of The Snake?” Have you heard? Should I do it? President Donald J. Trump: (33:42)\\nSo this has to do with this subject. And it’s been a long time since I’ve done this one, but so many people are asking. You ready? The Snake. On her way to work one morning down the path, along the Lake, a tender hearted woman, saw a poor half frozen snake. His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew. “Poor thing,” she cried. “I’ll take you in and I’ll take care of you.” “Take me in oh, tender woman. Take me in for heaven’s sake. Take me in oh, tender woman,” sighed that vicious snake. President Donald J. Trump: (34:24)\\nShe wrapped him up all cozy in a comforter of silk. And she laid him by the fireside with some honey and some milk. She hurried home from work that night. As soon as she arrived, she found that pretty snake she’d taken in had been revived. “Take me in oh, tender woman. Take me in for heaven’s sake. Take me in oh, tender woman,” sighed that vicious snake. President Donald J. Trump: (34:53)\\nShe clutched him to her bosom. “You’re so beautiful, she cried, ” But I hadn’t brought you in by now, you know, you would have died.” She stroked his pretty skin again and kissed and held him tight. But instead of saying, thank you, this snake gave her a vicious bite. “Take me in oh, tender woman. Take me in for heaven’s sake. Take me in, oh, tender woman,” sighed that vicious snake. “I saved you,” cried the woman,',\n",
       "  ' “And you bit me, but why? You knew your bite was poisonous and now I’m going to die.” “Shut up, silly woman,” said the reptile with a grin. “You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.” President Donald J. Trump: (35:47)\\nSo, I’ve been asked by so many people. I’ve been asked to do that one by so many people, but that pertains a little bit to what we see going on. And you look at Paris and you look at the attacks over the last week and you… President Donald J. Trump: (36:03)\\n… Paris and you look at the attacks over the last week and you look at what’s happening and we are doing very well. We are doing very well. We have a very strong policy. We put in a ban that a lot of people were upset about and now they’re saying, thank you very much for the ban. We appreciate it very much. President Donald J. Trump: (36:20)\\nWe invested $2.5 trillion in the US military. We also passed VA Choice and VA Accountability for our great vets. We have a 91% approval rating with our vets. That’s the highest by a lot in history, that by direction, the United States military conducted a successful operation to rescue an American hostage, last night. Kidnapped overseas just 96 hours earlier; incredible people. President Donald J. Trump: (36:56)\\nThe US special forces brilliantly executed a daring nighttime operation. Over the last four years, we have rescued a record 55 hostages and detainees in more than 24 countries and we pay nothing because once you pay, those numbers go very high, but this operation should serve as a stark warning to terrorists and thugs who try to kidnap our people. You cannot escape the long reach of American military and American justice. President Donald J. Trump: (37:36)\\nSo this happened last night. We’re very proud of them. I was at Fort Bragg and by the way, we’re leaving the name Fort Bragg in case you had any [inaudible 00:01:45]. Let That word out if you don’t mind. Cancel culture. Let’s cancel. Let’s change everything. Naw. We’re leaving the name Fort Bragg. A lot of… We won two world wars out of Fort Bragg and other great places. Gee, let’s change the name of Fort Bragg. President Donald J. Trump: (38:04)\\nWe obliterated the ISIS caliphate and we killed the leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. We eliminated the mass murder of US troops. Soleimani is dead. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal. I recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. So recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights; 52 years, they negotiated that deal. We did it in less than two hours and we are now forging peace in the Middle East. Already three countries and they’re lined up. President Donald J. Trump: (38:49)\\nA vote for me in the Republican party is a vote to save the American Dream. And in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. President Donald J. Trump: (39:13)\\nWe will hire more police, increase penalties on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. With God’s help, we will defend the right to life, religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. Your Second Amendment. President Donald J. Trump: (39:40)\\nWhich Sleepy Joe will not be doing any of that. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. And we are the',\n",
       "  ' envy of the world, military. $2.5 trillion but we have the finest missiles and rockets and tanks and jets. What we’ve done, submarines. We have the greatest military and our nuclear arsenal has been updated and is a tippy-top shape. And only hope to God, we never have to use it. Hope to God, we never have to use it. President Donald J. Trump: (40:17)\\nWe will end surprise medical billing. Require price transparency starts on January 1st, all done. Lower drug prices even more. Going to bring them down to the lowest anywhere in the world. I’ve exercised a thing called Favored Nations. The drug companies do not like me too much and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. President Donald J. Trump: (40:45)\\nAmerica will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust. President Donald J. Trump: (41:26)\\nFor years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of North Carolina. President Donald J. Trump: (41:41)\\nTwo days from now, America’s fate is in your hands. You must get out and vote. This is the most important election, possibly in the history of our country. You must let everyone know, go get them, go grab your family, grab your boss, grab your coworkers, grab them all. Got to get out and vote. So important. President Donald J. Trump: (42:04)\\nFrom Asheville to Charlotte, from Wilmington to Raleigh and from Greensboro to right here in Hickory, great place. Greatest furniture in the world. I bought plenty of it and it’s much better than what they make in China. That I can tell you. I know it well. There’s a big difference. We inherit the legacy of red blooded American patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears to defend our country and to defend our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes, right? These are great, great heroes, who crossed the oceans, settled the continent, tame the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the great skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world and the best is yet to come. President Donald J. Trump: (43:11)\\nProud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. President Donald J. Trump: (43:35)\\nVote for Tom. Get Tom in there, right? We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible people of North Carolina, we have made America powerful again; our military. President Donald J. Trump: (43:54)\\nWe have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again and we will make America great again. President Donald J. Trump: (44:16)\\nThank you, North Carolina, go out and vote. Thank y'],\n",
       " ['Ben Carson: (00:01)\\n… but a great friend of America, our Vice President, the 48th Vice President of the United States. And I’ll tell you something interesting about him in terms of how much of an influence he’s already been in what’s going on. He has cast as the President of the Senate more tie-breaking votes than the four Vice Presidents before him combined. So he is at the right place at the right time. He served in Congress from 2001 till 2003. He was the 50th Governor of Iowa. And as if that wasn’t enough, he practiced law, was a talk show host on the radio, and has served as a spectacular Vice President so far, providing tremendous leadership on foreign affairs, but also on domestic issues. Ben Carson: (01:04)\\nAs you know, he’s the Chairman of the Coronavirus Task Force. I’m a member of that. I can tell you, he has so rapidly picked up the scientific and medical concepts, I mean, he should have been a doctor. He is really, really good. And being able to coordinate so many things and take diverse points of view and make everybody feel like they’re important. And what’s really interesting, if you think back to March, when about a third of elderly people who were contracting the virus were dying and now 94.7% of them are surviving, so that tells you that he has been very successful on the task force. It has been very successful. He also is a man of great wisdom and perspective who I believe the good Lord has placed here for a time such as this. And this is a very troubling time. I remember when I first took office, a senior government official came to me and said, “You have to stop all this God stuff. You cannot keep talking about God.” And I just told him to take a hike. I said, “Because I’m going to talk about God. I am always going to.” That’s like saying, “Cut your heart out and continue to work.” That really doesn’t work very well. But where did all this no God stuff come from? I don’t think people really know the history of our country and how vital God was to those who started our country. Take George Washington, he was acting as a courier for one of the generals. Back and forth, across dangerous territories, being shot at. And some years later, still before he was President, he came back to the area and one of the Indian chiefs who was very elderly and close to death, had his people carry him to where Washington was. Ben Carson: (03:37)\\nAnd he said, “I just wanted to meet you, sir, because I shot you four times and you’re still here.” And there were, in fact, four bullet holes and Washington’s coat, but no flesh wounds. He was being protected. And many people know the story of the battle of Long Island when Washington was down to his last battalion. We’d been wiped out. It was looking very grim. They were surrounded on land and on sea. And it looked like it was going to be the end of our Revolutionary War. But the meteorologic records, which are still available today, demonstrate that, that evening a very strange, dense fog fell over the area. It lasted through the night and into the next day, providing cover for Washington so that they could escape. And some people want to say that it’s a coincidence. I don’t think that that’s a coincidence. Ben Carson: (04:44)\\nI think God has been involved from the beginning because our founders honored God. A lot of people who want to rewrite our history try to tell you that, “Our founders didn’t believe in God.” All you have to do is go back and look at their writings and I think you’ll be very convinced that they very much did believe in God. And then you have all of the people talking about separation of church and state. You’ll never hear that coming out of Vice President Pence’s mouth. Separation of church and state is not in the U.S. Constitution. It is not there. Nowhere. And there was a Supreme Court ruling a few decades ago where it was mentioned but only in the context that the state should not rule the church and the church should not rule the state. That’s all it meant. It didn’t mean that people who work in government cannot speak and act upon their faith. Be',\n",
       "  'n Carson: (05:49)\\nAnd when Alexis de Tocqueville came to America to study it, because Americans were doing so well, this young fledgling nation, and no one could explain it. And he said, “I’m going to go there and I’m going to study them in depth.” And in the last chapter of that two volumes that he talked about the influence of the church. The fiery pulpits, which gave the people, their courage and their moral rectitude enough to be able to defeat the most powerful military force in the world. So faith is a big part of us. It’s a big part of us as individuals too if we stop and examine our lives. I remember when I was a young attending neurosurgeon and I thought I was pretty hot stuff. And there came this young child from Georgia who was four years old. He was a child prodigy. At age two, he was already quoting Bible verses. But when he was four, he started stumbling. He started slobbering. He had double vision and he was diagnosed with malignant brainstem tumor. Ben Carson: (07:05)\\nAnd they saw many people. Everybody gave him the same diagnosis, told them to take the boy home, keep them comfortable and let them die. And they ended up at Johns Hopkins. And I remember seeing that boy come in to the ward rolled on a stretcher and his eyes were looking in different directions, foaming at the mouth, barely moving, barely breathing. I was saying, “What am I supposed to do with him?” I looked at the CAT scan. There was this big, ugly brainstem tumor. And the parents said, “Doctor, we were directed here by God because we would find a Christian neurosurgeon who could heal our son.” And I said, “But this is a malignant brainstem tumor. There’s nothing I or anyone else can do about this.” And they said, “But doctor, the Lord sent us here to see you.” I said, “Okay, I tell you what.” I said, “Let’s do an MRI.” MRIs were new at that time. I said, “Maybe it’ll show something the CAT scan doesn’t show.” Ben Carson: (08:16)\\nWe did the MRI. All the neuroradiologists looked at it. They said, “It’s a malignant brainstem tumor. Nothing to do.” I came back and told them. And they said, “But doctor, the Lord.” I said, ” Okay.” I said, “Look, one in 1000 times the scans are wrong. So maybe this is some kind of inflammatory reaction. So I’ll go in and I’ll do a biopsy.” And they said, “Oh, thank you, doctor. Thank you.” And I went in and there was this big, ugly grayish red mass, and I took a frozen section biopsy, sent it off. It came back high grade glioma, a very malignant tumor. And I took out as much as I dared until I started running across vital structures. I said, “I better stop.” Closed him up, went out to talk to the parents. And I said, “Unfortunately, it looks like it is what we thought. And only God knows how long a person is supposed to be here. Maybe he’s already served his purpose and we’ll understand it better by and by,” and all the things we tell people. Ben Carson: (09:27)\\nAnd they said, “Thank you, doctor. But the Lord is going to heal her son.” As I walked away, I was thinking, I’ve never seen people with that kind of faith fully expecting over the next few days he would deteriorate and die. But instead, his eyes started looking in the same direction. He started handling his secretions. I said, “What’s going on?” I said, “Let’s do another MRI.” And we did and there was still a big early tumor. But there was a little ribbon of tissue way up in the corner, and I said, “Is it possible that maybe this was not in the brainstem, it just crushed and displaced the brainstem. Maybe I should go back in.” And they said, “By all means.” And I went back in and the nature of that tumor was different. And as I peeled it away layer by layer under the microscope, I got to the last layer and pulled it away. And there was a brainstem glistening white, intact, smashed, and displaced. Long story short, that boy walked out of the hospital and today he’s a minister. Ben Carson: (10:44)\\nThose are the kinds of things that build faith. And one of the oncologists told me after that, he said, “Ben, I’ve always been an atheist. I’m not anymore.” ',\n",
       "  'But the fact of the matter was really for me because I thought I was doing all this stuff. And I came to realize, as Vice President Pence fully realizes, that it is God, that he uses us as instruments if we are willing to allow him to use us. And Vice President Pence recognizes that the election that we’re facing, it’s not about Democrats or Republicans. It’s about people who believe that this country is of, for, and by the people and people who believe it’s of, for, and by the government. And people who believe in our Judeo-Christian foundation and those who think that that’s a bunch of silliness. And it is so important for people to recognize that this is about not a person or a personality, this is about concepts. Ben Carson: (11:51)\\nThis is about the future for our children and our grandchildren. We cannot be thrown off because we don’t like somebody or the way that they say something. That’s really taking the small view. And that’s something that our Vice President does not do. He is a man who lives by Godly principles of loving your fellow man, caring about your neighbor, developing your God given talents to the utmost so that you become valuable to the people around you, having values and principles that govern his life. And we are very, very fortunate to have with us today, the 48th Vice President of the United States, Michael Richard Pence. Vice President Mike Pence: (12:44)\\nWell, hello Iowa. To Bob Vanderplatz, his wife, Darla, all of my fellow Americans, it’s great to be back in the Hawkeye State with all of the amazing men and women of The Family Leader. Give yourselves a round of applause. What a great organization. It’s great to be here today just 33 days from what I believe will be a great victory for faith and family all across Iowa and all across America. And I want to thank Dr. Ben Carson for those inspiring words and for his friendship. Abraham Lincoln said his only ambition in life was to be esteemed. Vice President Mike Pence: (14:02)\\nAbraham Lincoln said his only ambition in life was to be esteemed by people he esteemed. And I have to tell you, America is blessed by the steady, principled, faith filled leadership of Dr. Ben Carson. Would you join me in thanking Ben Carson for all that he means to the life of this nation? We cherish you and Candy so much. Ben and I have gotten to know each other over the last several years, serving shoulder to shoulder and a better man I’ve never known, but Ben does know that the introduction I prefer is a little bit shorter. I’m a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican in that order. And it is wonderful to be here with The Family Leader. And I want to say, thanks also to Bob Vander Plaats and his amazing wife Darla, for all they’ve done for the cause of conservative and pro family values here in Iowa. And in more than a dozen states across the country, Bob and Darla for all you’ve done strengthening families. For all you’ve done to promote faith and leadership and revival. Can we hear it for Bob and Darla and The Family Leader team for all they’ve done? Thank you all for being a part of this vital ministry in the life of the nation. We’re so grateful. Vice President Mike Pence: (15:28)\\nYou know, Bob and The Family Leader, are really emblematic of a very rich tradition in the United States of America. Even a casual study of the history of this nation shows that people of faith have made the difference throughout our country’s history. From the very founding of the nation, the Robed Regiments of the American revolution, the preachers of revival in our great awakenings, the way that the pulpits of America thundered for abolition of slavery and led the Civil Rights Movement. It has been people of faith, I believe with all of my heart who have led us toward a more perfect union. And I want to congratulate and thank each and every one of you for being a part of continuing that great American tradition. Vice President Mike Pence: (16:24)\\nBut it’s so good to be here with so many friends, including a man, who I thought he was from Minnesota. But he is a man of faith ',\n",
       "  'who’s been a champion of everything that we hold dear. And he actually was kind enough to bring my sister and my niece down from Minnesota. Would you join me in thanking Mike Lindell and the whole team that’s down from My Pillow. Thanks for all you do for people of faith and the conservative cause, Mike. Vice President Mike Pence: (16:59)\\nSo thanks to all the friends who are here and speaking of friends, allow me to bring greetings from another friend of mine. A man who I can tell you firsthand, has fought to keep the promises that he’s made to people of faith. People dedicated to family, people who believe in freedom, every single day. The last three and a half years, I bring greetings from the 45th president of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. I don’t know if y’all had a chance to see that debate night before last. I’ll tell you what, if you ever doubted that we had a fighter in the White house, you don’t doubt it anymore. President Donald Trump took our case to the American people, and he took the fight to Joe Biden. And, case you didn’t know it. I’m headed to Salt Lake City next week to debate with his running mate. And I promise you, President Trump and I are going to keep on fighting for faith, and family, and freedom. And we’re going to fight 33 days to earn four more years in the White House. Vice President Mike Pence: (18:08)\\nAnd we’re going to tell our story and I challenge each and every one of you to do the same. Because we’ve got an incredible story to tell about what we’ve accomplished for this country. I mean, the truth is President Trump has literally kept the promises that he’s made to the people of Iowa and all the states so well-represented here at The Family Leader, but think about it. Four years ago, we inherited a military that had been hollowed out by devastating budget cuts. An economy, struggling to break out of the slowest economic recovery since the great depression. Terrorism was on the rise around the world. And worst of all, we had this eight years of a steady assault on our most cherished values and liberties. Vice President Mike Pence: (18:57)\\nAnd I’m here to tell you three and a half years on, from when the people of Iowa said, “Yes” to President Donald Trump, I couldn’t can be more proud to report, not just as your vice president, but as the father of a Marine and the proud father-in-law of a United States Navy pilot, we rebuilt our military. We restored the arsenal of democracy. President Donald Trump has signed the largest increases in our National Defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. And we’re finally giving our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and space force, the resources and the support that they need to defend this land of freedom. Vice President Mike Pence: (19:46)\\nAnd with that renewed American strength, under the president it’s leadership, our armed forces have taken the fight to radical Islamic terrorists on our terms, on their soil. Where Joe sent pallets of cash to the mullahs in Iran, president Donald Trump got us out of the Iranian nuclear deal. And I was there, when president Donald Trump, without hesitation gave the order to take out the world’s most dangerous terrorists and Qasem Soleimani is gone. Vice President Mike Pence: (20:17)\\nThe President Donald Trump has put the security of America first. And in our first three years, our president also took decisive action to revive the American economy. Where Joe Biden has plans to raise taxes across the board. President Donald Trump has cut taxes for small businesses and large, cut taxes for working families. We rolled back in those first three years, more federal red tape already than any president in American history. We unleashed American energy. We fought for free and fair trade. And in just three short years, businesses, large and small, created more than 7 million good paying jobs, including nearly 12,000 jobs right here in Iowa. Vice President Mike Pence: (21:09)\\nSo it’s been about security. It’s been about prosperity, in these first three years. And every step of the way your president',\n",
       "  ', and our administration have stood for the rule of law and the principles we cherish. So I stand before you today, we’ve seen confirmed more than 230 conservative judges to our federal courts at every level. And I can tell you, they are all men and women who will uphold the God-given liberties enshrined in our constitution. Like the freedom of speech, the freedom of religion, and the second amendment right to keep and bear arms Vice President Mike Pence: (21:49)\\nLast week, we paused as a nation to honor the life of service of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. But after the memorials were over, President Donald Trump did his duty. The Constitution provides that the president shall nominate judges to the Supreme Court in the event of a vacancy. And president Donald Trump did just that when he nominated a remarkable, principled, conservative woman of amazing intellect and a beautiful family who will uphold the constitution of the United States to our Supreme Court. He nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett. Two days ago, I had the privilege of escorting Judge Barrett to the United States Senate. And she’s on Capitol Hill all this week. Meeting with members of the Senate. We challenged Democrats in the Senate to provide Judge Barrett with a respectful and dignified hearing, and to give America the kind of confirmation process American people deserve. But we have reason to be concerned. You all remember her last confirmation hearing just a few short years ago, when she was nominated to the court of appeals. During Judge Barrett’s confirmation hearing the Democrat chairman of the judiciary committee, criticized her Catholic faith. Saying that “The dogma lives loudly within you.” And Hollywood elites have already begun to criticize her and her family for their commitment to their faith. Well, I got news for the Democrats and the Hollywood elites that dogma lives loudly in me, that dogma lives loudly in hundreds of millions of Americans. And every American who cherishes faith has the right to live and work and worship according to the dictates of our faith and conscience enshrined in the Constitution of the United States. The American people cherish the freedom of religion of every American and every faith. And these attacks on Judge Barrett’s faith must stop. Vice President Mike Pence: (24:18)\\nThe Senate has a job to do, to discharge their duty, to advise and consent. And we’ll work with any willing member of the Senate to do just that. But I tell you, we’re going to fill that seat. And Judge Amy Coney Barrett is going to be Justice Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court of the United States. So president Trump has stood for the rule of law. He kept his word to the people of Iowa and all the great states represented here and all of our country. He appointed those principled conservatives to our courts at every level, all the way through Judges Barrett’s nomination. And every single day of this administration, President Donald Trump and I have stood without apology for the men and women who serve on the thin blue line of law enforcement. Vice President Mike Pence: (25:18)\\nI think people in The Family Leader know, men and women who serve in law enforcement are some of the best people in it in this country. President Trump and I, like all of you, will always support and defend the Constitutional right of every American to engage in peaceful protest. But rioting and looting is not peaceful protest. Burning businesses is not free speech. Violence against innocent civilians or property, or law enforcement, will not be tolerated. And those who do these things will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. For months, all Joe Biden talked about was peaceful protests. Remember that? An entire summer. As Americans living in our major cities, literally watched businesses in their communities burn. Mike, I was just in Minneapolis, just a few short days ago. And I traveled into the heart of the city that had been beset by the rioting, and the looting, and the violence that followed the killing of George Floyd. I spent some time with Flora W',\n",
       "  'estborough, an extraordinary African-American woman. She started a Flora’s Salon, 35 years ago, and yet she watched in horror just days after that terrible event, as looters moved closer and closer and closer, and burned her and her son’s business to the ground. But I told Flora, we are with you, the American people are with you. And we’re going to rebuild Flora’s Salon and Minneapolis. Vice President Mike Pence: (27:07)\\nAnd so we are. The truth is, Joe Biden would actually double down on the policies that have led to violence in America’s cities. When you withdraw support for those who serve and protect, I believe that you embolden those who threaten our families, and our peace in the streets. Joe Biden actually says that America is in his words, systemically racist. And that law enforcement has, and I quote, “An implicit bias against minorities.” When Joe Biden was asked if he’d support cutting funding for law enforcement, he replied. “Yes, absolutely.” Vice President Mike Pence: (27:50)\\nAnd his running mate said again, earlier this week, that it was time to quote, “Re-imagine law enforcement.” Well, let me make you a promise, under President Donald Trump- Vice President Mike Pence: (28:03)\\nWell, let me make you a promise, under President Donald Trump we’re not going to re-imagine anything, we’re going to back the blue, and we’re not going to defund the police, not now, not ever. President Trump and I know you don’t have to make a choice between supporting law enforcement and supporting our African-American neighbors or other minorities in our communities, we have done both and we’ll continue to do both with four more years in the White House. Under this president, we’ve provided resources to hire 4,000 more police officers, this summer in the wake of violence in our cities we launched Operation Legend and we’ve already seen to the arrest of more than 2,500 violent offenders in our major cities. The program itself was named after a four year old boy who was shot and killed in gang violence while he slept in the pillow fort that he and his dad constructed. Vice President Mike Pence: (28:58)\\nSo, we’ve supported law enforcement, but I couldn’t be more proud to be vice president to a president whose policies saw in our first three years the lowest unemployment ever recorded for African-Americans, the highest investment in historically Black colleges and universities, 8,000 opportunity zones in every major city attracting investment and jobs, and a president who has fought to let parents in our inner cities choose where their children go to school regardless of their income or area code. So we’re going to continue to support law enforcement, we’re going to continue to support our African-American families with better opportunities, better education, and more public safety. And under President Donald Trump, we’re going to have law and order in every city, in every state in this nation, for every American of every race, and creed, and color, so help us, God. So we’ve made incredible progress. Vice President Mike Pence: (30:05)\\nBut as supporters and friends of The Family Leader know, in President Donald Trump you’ve had a leader whose kept his promises to people of faith like no other in my lifetime. It’s remarkable to think that four previous presidents in both political parties had promised the American people and our most cherished ally to take action, but it was President Donald Trump who kept that promise when he moved the American Embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the State of Israel. And I was alongside the president when the phone started to ring and he was preparing to keep that promise, Bob, and to say that virtually every leader in the world and every foreign policy elite in Washington, DC was against, would be an understatement. I mean, one called after another, didn’t they, Ben? They said, “Don’t do it.” They said that it would make peace less possible, but President Donald Trump believed that it would make peace more possible. Vice President Mike Pence: (31:15)\\nThe man who wrote The Art of the Deal had the ',\n",
       "  'view that if you want to negotiate peace, the first thing you do is you take off the table what’s not negotiable, and Jerusalem is the eternal capital of the Jewish State of Israel. And confirming the president since, I don’t know if you all saw just a couple short weeks ago, for the first time in 26 years two Arab nations formally recognized the Jewish State of Israel and we believe there are more on the way. Beyond the strong stand and the keeping of promises, I will tell you, I couldn’t be more proud to serve as vice president to a president who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. President Donald Trump is the most pro-life president in American history, it’s true. On just our fourth day in office, the president re-instated what’s known as the Mexico City policy, ending taxpayer funding of foreign programs that provide or promote abortion around the world. Vice President Mike Pence: (32:51)\\nAnd it was this president who earlier this year became the first president since Roe v. Wade to go to the National Mall and address the March for Life in person, we stand with those who stand for life. But you deserve to know that Joe Biden and the radical left support taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth, they’re calling for historic increases in funding for Planned Parenthood of America. And after spending an entire career since Roe vs. Wade, supporting what came to be known as the Hyde Amendment, a great piece of legislation by the late Henry Hyde that prevented taxpayer dollars from being used to pay for abortions in America, last year Joe Biden reversed his historic position in support of the Hyde Amendment and now supports taxpayer funding of abortion. I must tell you, and Ben mentioned how many tie-breaking votes I’ve cast as vice president, but I got to tell you, the one I’m proudest of was the day I was able to cast the tie-breaking vote in the United States Senate to allow states to defund planned parenthood, and President Donald Trump signed it into law. So, we’ve stood for life. And from day one, this president has also stood strong for what’s come to be known as our first freedom, that is religious freedom enshrined in our constitution. Early on in our administration, the president took steps to free up the pulpits of America. We believe that the freedom of speech should not end at the front doors of our churches, and synagogues, and houses of worship, and President Donald Trump stopped enforcement of the Johnson Amendment and restored the freedom of speech, the leaders of faith. We’ve also taken steps to respect the conscience rights of doctors, and nurses, and teachers, and religious charities all across America. And it was this president and this administration that ended the assault on the Little Sisters of the Poor, and the Supreme Court made it permanent just weeks ago. It’s remarkable to think that a group of nuns who had taken a lifetime vow of poverty to support and help the underserved community, were hauled into court when Joe Biden was vice president for the sole purpose of requiring them to compromise their faith to live under the strictures of Obamacare. Vice President Mike Pence: (36:05)\\nThe Supreme Court actually voted by seven to two to make permanent the efforts to conform the Little Sisters of the Poor to Obamacare, but Joe Biden has already announced that if elected president he’ll reimpose the Obamacare mandates on the Little Sisters of the Poor and on religious institutions, and his own running mate actually attacked one of our judicial nominees for being a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus. So let me just say, these attacks on the freedom of religion must stop in America, and with four more years we will stand for the religious freedom of every American of every faith. So we accomplished so much in our first three years, we rebuilt our military, revived our economy, stood for life, and our liberties, and law and order, and the faith and freedom of every American. In three short years, as I like to say, we made America great again, we di',\n",
       "  'd. But then, as Ben shared, and he’s a valued member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, then the coronavirus struck from China. But I want you all to know that before the very first documented case of community transmission within the United States, our president did what no American president had ever done before. Before the month of January was out, he suspended all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world. Now, Joe Biden called it hysterical, he called it xenophobic. But I can tell you as the head of the task force, that action alone saved untold American lives and it bought us invaluable time to stand up the largest national mobilization since World War II. We’ve reinvented testing, more than 100 million tests performed today, 150 million new point of care tests that are being distributed to states all across the country as we speak. We worked with manufacturing here in Iowa and all across the country to see to the production and the distribution of literally billions of medical supplies for our doctors, and nurses, and healthcare workers. Vice President Mike Pence: (38:39)\\nOur FDA worked to make new medicines available like remdesivir and convalescent plasma. And I’m proud to report to you that with American innovation, our dedicated researchers, we believe, are just literally weeks away from the first coronavirus vaccine for the American people, and we’ll have tens of millions of doses available the moment that it’s approved. We’ve demonstrated as a nation that we can slow the spread, we’re going to continue to protect the vulnerable, continue to save lives, and we’re opening up America again. Thanks to the strong foundation poured by our president, supported by all of you, that foundation of less taxes, less regulation, more American energy, after losing 22 million jobs at the height of this pandemic, we’ve already seen 10.6 million Americans go back to work including 97,000 people right here in Iowa. Vice President Mike Pence: (39:49)\\nAnd we’re not just opening up America, we’re opening up American schools. And I’m proud to report to you that my wife of 35 years is already back in the classroom at the Christian School, outside Washington, DC, where she teaches every day. We’ve been there for our doctors, our nurses, our healthcare workers, and we’re going to make sure our teachers and administrators have everything they need to safely reopen as we strive for that day with a vaccine that we put the coronavirus in the past. It’s remarkable to think what we’ve been through over the course of this year, we’ve gone through a time of testing, but I came here today, as all of you know at The Family Leader, because we’re coming to a time for choosing. The choice in this election has never been clear, the stakes have never been higher. I believe that when you look at their agenda, it’s clear that Joe Biden would be nothing more than a Trojan horse for the radical left. Vice President Mike Pence: (40:49)\\nI mean, Joe Biden has said that democracy is on the ballot, and certainly our economic recovery is on the ballot, law and order are on the ballot, but I also believe that there are things much more foundational and fundamental that are on the ballot as well. I think between now and November 3rd, it’s not going to be so much whether we end up more Republican or more Democrat, more liberal or more conservative, more red or more blue, I think the choice we face in this nation, in this year, is whether America remains America. It’s whether we are going to chart a course for our children and grandchildren and a future that’s based on the timeless ideals enshrined in our constitution, our belief in free enterprise and free market and the American dream, or whether we’re going to take that hard left turn, the well-worn path, the government control, and a managed economy, the path to socialism. That’s why I believe for the sake of our freedom… Vice President Mike Pence: (42:01)\\nThat’s why I believe for the sake of our freedom, for the sake of all the ideals that have made this nation truly great in the',\n",
       "  ' past. We need to decide right here and right now, that Joe Biden will never be president of the United States of America, that we’re going to reelect President Donald Trump for four more years. So, I thank you for hearing me out. I thank you for your faith, for your enthusiasm and for all the family leader’s done to stand with those who stand with our most cherished values, each and every day. It truly is an honor to be with you here. I’d encourage you in the days ahead, to keep telling your neighbors and friends, at work and at worship, that all that we’ve accomplished as a nation, and all that’s at stake in the days ahead. And be confident as you go. Vice President Mike Pence: (43:03)\\nIn all my travels across the country, over the last four years, to big cities and small towns, I’m convinced of two things. That America is a freedom loving nation, and America is a nation of faith. Everywhere I go, people speak to me about their faith, with a word of encouragement. Sweetest words I ever hear, is when people will say as they did over at Carter Lake earlier today. Reach out maybe across a rope line and just say, “I’m praying for you.” And I want you all to know, we feel those prayers every day. I think the American people know that the foundation of America is freedom, but the foundation of freedom is faith. The truth is, faith is at the very heart of who we are as Americans. And I believe the foundation of this country is strengthened each and every day, by the stand that each and every one of you take. Vice President Mike Pence: (44:17)\\nPresident Lincoln reminded us, “It is the duty of nations as well as of men, to recognize the sublime truth announced in the Holy scriptures and proven by all histories, that those nations are only blessed whose God is the Lord.” And so as I leave here today, in these challenging times, and urge you to hold fast to freedom, let’s also hold fast to faith, and let’s remember to pray. The Bible tells us, “That the prayer of the upright pleases him. That prayer reaches heaven, his Holy dwelling place.” And then in times of great challenge in our life or in the life of the nation, we’re not to be anxious about anything, but in everything, in every form of prayer and petition with Thanksgiving, we’re to present our request to God, and know that the peace of God that passes all understanding will guard our hearts and minds in Christ Jesus. Vice President Mike Pence: (45:23)\\nAs Ben Carson said, “We’re passing through difficult days as a nation. Too much division in our country today. An election of such a consequence, may well be one of the most important elections in the life of this nation.” But I believe more than ever, that people of faith should pray. And coming here today, I want to encourage you, practice that prayer in a renewed way. As we think of the challenges and the times in which we live, the more than 200,000 of our countrymen that have been lost. We think of the grief of those families who have always been on our hearts. Those that are struggling with disease today, as we think of the economic hardship that people still face, in the midst of the recovery that’s underway. We think of the violence besetting families in our major cities. Let’s claim that ancient promise, that if His people, who are called by His name, will humble themselves and pray in turn, he’ll do like he’s always done in the long and storied history of this country. He’ll hear from heaven and he’ll heal this land. Vice President Mike Pence: (46:38)\\nSo, thank you for the warm welcome. I was humbled by what Bob Vanderplatz said, that I’m coming to you today, but you said, “I come from you.” And I hope you can hear my heart today. And while I’m at it, standing here in Iowa, let me say, it is the greatest honor of my life to serve as your vice-president. And on behalf of my family, I want to thank you for the great privilege of serving in this role for yours. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Vice President Mike Pence: (47:46)\\nMy pastor told me one time that, “Everybody is under-encouraged.” And I can te',\n",
       "  'll you that I leave here today encouraged. Know that you’ve encouraged your vice-president. I know you’ve encouraged Ben and Candy, and all those in our delegation today and we thank you. And I leave here today, believing more than ever that God is at work. Vice President Mike Pence: (48:08)\\nAs I close, let me just share a story. It was a few months ago, I was reminded that even when it doesn’t seem that way, God is still working. See, I got a letter, from a pastor who leads a small church, just outside Jacksonville, Florida. He wrote to me of a time many years ago, that he and his wife were attending Asbury Seminary in Wilmore, Kentucky, it’s back in the 1970s. It was a place where they held in the spring of every year, a Christian music festival. Where they would have music, and then they would have preachers who would present the Gospel and invite young people from all across the region. Vice President Mike Pence: (48:54)\\nBut he wrote to me that in 1977, he had decided at the seminary, they had collectively decided to end the Christian music festival, it was known as Ichthus. But he and his new bride, felt a burden to take on the task. Even though he wrote, and I quote, “That several friends told us that it would be very hard on our new marriage and we shouldn’t do it.” But he said, “We answered the call. They gathered a few other seminarians, as he told me, and they worked a whole year long to arrange the event in the spring of 1978. And then he told me, that the night came, the culminating evening on Saturday night, when everything was to come together, and the main preaching was done. And he and his new bride were walking through the camp area, and it was raining and they were deeply disappointed. They thought it had all been for naught. Vice President Mike Pence: (49:58)\\nAnd then, he wrote these words in a letter, I quote, “And that’s because on that night, I didn’t know that a future vice-president of the United States of America would be giving his life to Jesus Christ.” He continued, “I cannot write this without tears. And I still can’t read it without tears. Because I remember that night, sitting on a hillside, it was raining and it was like I heard the words for the first time. That God so loved the world. That he sent his only begotten son, that whoever might believe in him might not perish, but have eternal life. Vice President Mike Pence: (50:46)\\nAnd that 19-year-old young man stood up and walked down that night, not out of a sense of intellectual agreement, but because my heart was broken with gratitude, for what had been done for me on the cross. I wrote a letter to that pastor, which I couldn’t write without tears. Not long after that, we actually met him and his wife and laughed together and prayed together. But I told him, “Now I know who else to thank for that night so many years ago, it changed my life.” The lesson in that letter to me though, was even when things don’t seem like they’re going the way we expect, they’re going the way he expected. The truth is, in the most challenging times in our nation, we can still claim a promise that we’ve had over the mantle of our home for now nearly 20 years. Vice President Mike Pence: (51:57)\\nI traveled to the little house that we lived in while we served in the Congress. It traveled to the governor’s residence in Indiana. And now, it’s over the mantle, in the home of the vice-presidency. It reads, “For I know the plans I have for you. Plans to prosper you and not to harm you. Plans to give you a hope and a future.” I believe with all my heart, that if we will hold fast to him, we have a hold fast to his promises, if we will hold up the example, the strength that comes through faith in Jesus Christ, that it will once again, be people of faith that see our way through these challenging times. That a hope and a future awaits beyond anything we could ask or imagine. And the best days for Iowa and America by God’s grace, are yet to come. Thank you very much. Thank you for the honor of being with you today. For all the work of the family leader and God bless A']]"
